# Base Docker images

The `ubuntu-18.04`, `ubuntu-20.04` and `ubuntu-22.04` images are based on the
[`public.ecr.aws/genialis/resolwe/base`](https://gallery.ecr.aws/genialis/resolwe/base) image.

These base images should be used for writing any new processes that are
considered for inclusion into Resolwe Bio.
